I am a third-year PhD student from the Department of Computer Science of [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Daisuke Kihara](https://kiharalab.org/). My research area is computational biology, mainly focusing on protein structure prediction, structure modelling and evaluation in Cryo-EM.

Before join Purdue, I graduated with a master's degree in computer science from [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/), Beijing, China in 2021. During my master, I mainly worked on natural language processing about multi-modal sentiment analysis in Key Lab of Web Data Science and Technology from [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ict.cas.cn/). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science from [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/) in 2018. During the summer of 2017, I worked with Dr. Xiwei Liu and Prof.[Fei-Yue Wang](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~wangfeiyue?language=en) from [State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems](http://www.compsys.ia.ac.cn/EN/index.html) of [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/), doing research about intelligent education.
